 一个同步辅助工具，允许一个或者多个线程等待一批在其他线程中执行的操作完成
CountDownLatch通过一个给定的count初始化，await函数会一直阻止，直到当前count通过countDown方
法达到0，这之后，所有等待的线程将释放，并进入await等待过程。

count是一次性设置的，不允许修改。如果你需要可以count的实现，考虑使用CyclicBarrier
CountDownLatch是一个有着多种用途的同步工具，可以用来达到很多效果，一个count为1的CountDownLatch
是一个简单的on/off的门闩，所有线程执行await将等待门通过countDown打开

一个count设置为N的CountDownLatch可以用于让线程等待N个线程，或者某个操作执行N次后再执行

<p>A useful property of a {@code CountDownLatch} is that it doesn't
	require that threads calling {@code countDown} wait for the count to
	reach zero before proceeding, it simply prevents any thread from
	proceeding past an {@link #await await} until all threads could pass.
<p>
	<b>Sample usage:</b> Here is a pair of classes in which a group of
	worker threads use two countdown latches:
<ul>
	<li>The first is a start signal that prevents any worker from
		proceeding until the driver is ready for them to proceed;
	<li>The second is a completion signal that allows the driver to
		wait until all workers have completed.
</ul>

<pre> {@code
 class Driver { // ...
   void main() throws InterruptedException {
     CountDownLatch startSignal = new CountDownLatch(1);
     CountDownLatch doneSignal = new CountDownLatch(N);

     for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) // create and start threads
       new Thread(new Worker(startSignal, doneSignal)).start();

     doSomethingElse();            // don't let run yet
     startSignal.countDown();      // let all threads proceed
     doSomethingElse();
     doneSignal.await();           // wait for all to finish
   }
 }

 class Worker implements Runnable {
   private final CountDownLatch startSignal;
   private final CountDownLatch doneSignal;
   Worker(CountDownLatch startSignal, CountDownLatch doneSignal) {
     this.startSignal = startSignal;
     this.doneSignal = doneSignal;
   }
   public void run() {
     try {
       startSignal.await();
       doWork();
       doneSignal.countDown();
     } catch (InterruptedException ex) {} // return;
   }

   void doWork() { ... }
 }}</pre>

<p>Another typical usage would be to divide a problem into N parts,
	describe each part with a Runnable that executes that portion and
	counts down on the latch, and queue all the Runnables to an Executor.
	When all sub-parts are complete, the coordinating thread will be able
	to pass through await. (When threads must repeatedly count down in this
	way, instead use a {@link CyclicBarrier}.)
<pre> {@code
 class Driver2 { // ...
   void main() throws InterruptedException {
     CountDownLatch doneSignal = new CountDownLatch(N);
     Executor e = ...

     for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i) // create and start threads
       e.execute(new WorkerRunnable(doneSignal, i));

     doneSignal.await();           // wait for all to finish
   }
 }

 class WorkerRunnable implements Runnable {
   private final CountDownLatch doneSignal;
   private final int i;
   WorkerRunnable(CountDownLatch doneSignal, int i) {
     this.doneSignal = doneSignal;
     this.i = i;
   }
   public void run() {
     try {
       doWork(i);
       doneSignal.countDown();
     } catch (InterruptedException ex) {} // return;
   }

   void doWork() { ... }
 }}</pre>

	actions following a successful return from a corresponding {@code
	await()} in another thread.
